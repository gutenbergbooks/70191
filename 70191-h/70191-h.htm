  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I.<br> <span class='large'>REMINISCENCES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>O’er Lake Erie’s dark, deep waters,—across
Ohio’s broad, rich lands, and still onward,
among the graceful forest trees, gushing
springs, and fertile plains of Kentucky,
rests in quiet beauty, the shady hillside,
bright green valley, and dancing waterbrook,
known as Glen’s Creek. No stately spire or
glittering dome point out the spot to the
passing traveller, but under the shadow of
the lofty trees stands a large brick edifice,
which has been consecrated to the worship of
God. There, each Sabbath, together congregate
the old and young, the lofty and the
lowly, bond and free, and the incense which
from that altar ascends to heaven is not the
less pure because in that secluded spot the
tones of the Sabbath bell never yet were
heard. Not far from the old brick church
are numerous time-stained grave-stones,
speaking to the living of the pale dead ones,
who side by side lie sleeping, unmindful of
the wintry storm or summer’s fervid heat.</p>

<p class='c007'>A little farther down the hill, and near
the apple tree, whose apples <i>never</i> get ripe,
stands a low white building,—the school
house of Glen’s Creek. There, for several
years, “Yankee schoolmasters,” one after
another, have tried by turns the effect of
moral suasion, hickory sticks and leathern
straps on the girls and boys who there assemble,
some intent upon mastering the
mysteries of the Latin Reader, and others
thinking wistfully of the miniature mill-dam
and fish-pond in the brook at the foot of the
hill, or of the play-house under the maple
tree, where the earthens are each day washed
in the little “tin bucket” which serves
the treble purpose of dinner-pail, wash-bowl,
and drinking-cup.</p>

<p class='c007'>But not with Glen’s Creek as it now is has
our story aught to do, although few have
been the changes since, in the times long
gone, the Indian warrior sought shelter from
the sultry August sun ’neath the bows of
the shady buckeye or towering honey locust,
which so thickly stud the hillside of Glen’s
Creek. Then, as now, the first spring violet
blossomed there, and the earliest crocus
grew near the stream whose waters sang as
mournfully to the dusky maiden of the forest,
as they since have to the fair daughter of the
pale-face.</p>

<p class='c007'>The incidents about to be narrated are believed
to have taken place near the commencement
of the nineteenth century, when
the country of Kentucky, from Lexington to
Louisville, was one entire forest, and when,
instead of the planter’s handsome dwelling,
now so common, there was only the rude log
hut surrounded, perhaps, by a few acres of
half-cleared land. Brave, indeed, must have
been the heart of the hardy yeoman, who,
forsaking the home of his fathers, went forth
into the wilds of Kentucky, and there, amid
dangers innumerable, laid the foundation of
the many handsome towns which now dot the
surface of that fair State. Woman, too,
timid, shrinking woman, was there, and in
moments of the most appalling danger the
daring courage she displayed equalled that
shown by her husband, father and brother.
Often on the still midnight air rang
out the fearful war-cry, speaking of torture
and death to the inmates of the
rude dwelling whose flames, rising high over
the tree tops, warned some other lonely settler
that the enemy was upon his track.</p>

<p class='c007'>But spite of all dangers and difficulties, the
tide of emigration poured steadily in upon
Kentucky, until where once the Indian
hunter and wild beast held undisputed sway,
there may now be seen fertile gardens and
cultivated fields, handsome towns and flourishing
cities.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='large'>DEACON WILDER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Brightly looked forth the stars on one
February night, while the pale moon, yet in
its first quarter, hung in the western sky,
illuminating as far as was possible the little
settlement of P——, Virginia. In a large
square building, the house of Deacon Wilder,
there was a prayer meeting, consisting mostly
of members from “the first families in Virginia.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In this meeting Deacon Wilder took a prominent
part, although there was an unusually
mournful cadence in the tones of his
voice; and twice during the reading of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>psalm was he obliged to stop for the purpose
of wiping from his eyes two large tear-drops,
which seemed sadly out of place on the
broad, good-humoured face of the deacon.
Other eyes there were, too, on whose long
lashes the heavy moisture glistened, and
whose faces told of some sad event which
either had happened or was about to happen.
The cause of all this sorrow was
this: Ere the night for the weekly
prayer meeting again came, Deacon
Wilder and his family, who were universally
liked, would be far on the road toward
home in the dense forests of Kentucky. In
that old-fashioned kitchen were many who
had come long, weary miles for the sake of
again shaking the deacon’s hand, and again
telling his gentle wife how surely their hearts
would go with her to her home in the far
west.</p>

<p class='c007'>The meeting proceeded decently and in
order, as meetings should, until near its
close, when Deacon Wilder, for the last
time, lifted up his voice in prayer with the
loved friends and neighbours he was leaving.
At this point, the grief of the little company
burst forth unrestrainedly. The white portion
of the audience gave vent to their feelings
in tears and half-smothered sobs, while
the blacks, of whom there was a goodly
number present, manifested their sorrow by
groans and loud lamentations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among these was an old negro named
Cato, who, together with his wife Dillah, had
formerly belonged to Deacon Wilder’s father,
but on his death they had passed into the
possession of the oldest son, Capt. Wilder,
who lived within a stone’s throw of his brother.
Old Cato was decidedly a Methodist
in practice, and when in the course of his
prayer Deacon Wilder mentioned that in all
human probability he should never on earth
meet them again, old Cato, who was looked
upon as a pillar by his coloured brethren,
forgetting in the intensity of his feelings the
exact form of words which he wanted, fervently
ejaculated, “Thank the Lord!” after
which Dillah, his wife, uttered a hearty
“Amen!”</p>

<p class='c007'>This mistake in the choice of words was a
slight set back to the deacon, who was feeling,
perhaps, a trifle gratified at seeing himself
so generally regretted. But Cato and
Dillah were a well-meaning couple, and
their mistake passed unnoticed, save
by the young people, who
smiled a little mischievously. The meeting
continued until a late hour, and the hands of
the long Dutch clock pointed to the hour of
midnight ere the windows of Deacon Wilder’s
dwelling were darkened, and its inmates
were dreaming, may be, of a home where
good-byes and partings were unknown.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next morning, long before the sun had dallied
with the east until over its gray cheek
the blushes of daylight were stealing, the
deacon’s family were astir. Fires were
lighted in the fire-place, candles were lighted
in the candlesticks, and breakfast was
swallowed in a space of time altogether too
short for the credulity of modern dyspeptics.
Then commenced the exciting process of
“pulling down” and “packing up.” Bedsteads
were knocked endwise, bed-clothes
were thrown all ways, crockery was smashed,
and things generally were put where
there was no possible danger of their being
found again for one twelvemonth. Deacon
Wilder scolded, his wife Sally scolded; old
Cato and Dillah, who had come over to superintend
matters, scolded; the other negroes
ran against each other and every way, literally
doing nothing except “’clarin’ they’s fit to
drap, they’s so tired;” while George, the
deacon’s oldest son, looked on, quietly whistling
“Yankee Doodle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the midst of this hubbub, little Charlie,
a bright, beautiful, but delicate boy of nine
summers, crept away to the foot of the garden,
and there, on a large stone under a tall
sugar maple, his face buried in his hands, he
wept bitterly. Poor Charlie! he was taking
his first lesson in home-sickness, even before
his childhood’s home had disappeared from
view. He had always been opposed to emigrating
to Kentucky, which, in his mind, was
all “dark, dark woods,” where each member
of the family would be tomahawked by
the Indians every day at least, if not oftener.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Charlie’s tears were unavailing—the
old homestead was sold, the preparations
were nearly completed, and in a few hours
he would bid good-bye to the places he loved
so well. “I shall never sit under this
tree again,” said the weeping boy, “never
again play in the dear old brook; and when
I die there, I shall be afraid to lie alone in the
dark woods, and there will be none but our
folks to cry for me, either.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A soft footstep sounded near, two little
arms were thrown round Charlie’s neck, and
a childish voice whispered, “Oh, Charlie,
Charlie, <i>I</i> will cry when I hear you are dead,
and if you will send for me before you die, I
will surely come.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was Ella, his cousin. She was a year
his junior, and since his earliest remembrance
she had been the object of his deepest
affection. Together they had played in the
forest shade, together in the garden had they
made their flower-beds, and together had
they mourned over torn dresses, lost mittens,
bumped heads, nettle stings, and so forth.
It is not altogether improbable that Charlie’s
grief arose partly from the fact that Ella
must be left behind. He had always been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>delicate, and frequently talked to Ella of dying,
so that she readily believed him when
he told her he should die in Kentucky; she
believed, too, that she should see him again
ere he died. Did she believe aright? The
story will tell you, but I shall not.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='large'>CATO AND DILLAH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Everything was in readiness except the
little waggon which was to convey the best
looking-glass, the stuffed rocking-chair, Mrs.
Wilder, and Charlie. On an old stump near
the gate sat Aunt Dillah, industriously wiping
the tears from her dusky cheeks, and
ever and anon exclaiming, “’Pears like I could
bar it better if I was gwine with them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This remark was overheard by her master,
Capt. Wilder. He had frequently heard
Cato express the same wish, and thought it
quite natural too, inasmuch as Jake, their
only child, was to accompany the deacon.
For a moment the captain stood irresolute.
We will not say what thoughts passed
through his mind, but after a time he went
away and in quest of his brother. There was
a short consultation, and then Capt. Wilder,
returning to Dillah, laid his hand on her
shoulder, and said, “Aunt Dillah, would it
please you and Cato to go to Kentucky, and
be killed with the Indians along with
Jake?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lor bless you, marster, that it would,”
said Dillah, rolling up her eyes till only the
whites were visible.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well, you can go,” was Capt. Wilder’s
reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>By this time old Cato and Jake had gathered
near, and the “Lord bless you’s” which
they poured in upon the captain sent him
into the house, out of sight and hearing.
But Dillah had no time to lose. Her goods
and chattels must be picked up, and old
Cato’s Sunday shirt must be wrung out of
the rinsing water, Dillah declaring “she
could kind o’ shake it out and dry it on the
road!” While putting up her things, the
old creature frequently lamented the unfortunate
fact that the new gown given her last
Christmas by “old Miss,” was not made,
“for,” said she, “I shall want to look
toppin’ and smart-like amongst the folks in
Kentuck.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ain’t no folks thar,” said Jake; but as
often as he repeated this assertion, Aunt
Dillah answered, “Now and then one, I
reckon, ’less why should marster tote the
whole on us out thar?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For the Injuns to eat, I s’pose,” answered
Jake, and then he went through with a
short rehearsal of what his mother would
say, and how she would yell, when one of the
natives got her in his grip. Little Ella wept
passionately when she learned that Dillah,
too, was going, but when Charlie, stealing up
to her, said “she will take care of me,” her
tears were dried, and her last words to Dillah
were, “Be kind to Charlie till he dies.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sweet Ella, it would seem that a foreshadowing
of the future had fallen around
her, for when at last Charlie’s farewell kiss
was warm upon her cheek, her voice was
cheerful as she said, “You will send for
me and I shall surely come.” Could she
have known how long and wearisome were
the miles, how dark and lonely was the
wood, and how full of danger was the road
which lay between her and Charlie’s future
home, she might not have been so sure that
they would meet again.</p>

<p class='c007'>One after another the waggons belonging
to Deacon Wilder passed down the narrow
road, and were lost to view in the deep
forest which stretched away to the west as
far as the eye could reach. Here for a short
time we will leave them, while we introduce
to our readers another family, whose fortunes
are closely interwoven with our first
party.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='large'>THE GORTONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Five years prior to the emigration of Deacon
Wilder, Mr. Gorton, a former neighbour,
had, with his family, removed to Kentucky,
and found a home near Lexington. Around
his fireside in Virginia once had gathered
three young children, Robert, Madeline and
Marian. Robert, the eldest, was not Mr.
Gorton’s son, but the child of a sister, Mrs.
Hunting, who on her death bed had bequeathed
her only boy to the care of her
brother. Madeline, when three years of
age, was one day missed from her father’s
house. Long and protracted search was
made, which resulted, at length, in the discovery
of a part of the child’s dress near a
spot where lay a pool of blood, and the mutilated
remains of what was probably once
the merry laughing Madeline. As only a
few of the bones and a small part of the
flesh was left, it was readily supposed that
the wolves, of which there were many at
that time in the woods, had done the bloody
deed. Amid many tears the remains were
gathered up, placed in a little coffin, and
buried beneath the aged oak under which
they were found. Years passed on, and the
lost Madeline ceased to be spoken of save
by her parents, who could never forget.</p>

<p class='c007'>Marian, the youngest and now the only
remaining daughter of Mr. Gorton, was, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the time of her father’s emigration, fourteen
years of age. She was a fair, handsome girl,
and already toward her George Wilder, who
was four years her senior, had turned his
eyes, as toward the star which was to illuminate
his future horizon. But she went
from him, and thenceforth his heart yearned
for the woods and hills of Kentucky, and it
was partly through his influence that his
father had finally determined to remove
thither. Thus, while Charlie, creeping to
the far end of the waggon, wept as he thought
of home and Ella, George was anticipating a
joyous meeting with the beautiful Marian,
and forming plans for the future, just as
thousands have done since and will do
again.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br> <span class='large'>THE NEW HOME.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is not our intention to follow our travellers
through the various stages of their long,
tiresome journey, but we will with them
hasten on to the close of a mild spring afternoon,
when the whole company, wearied and
spiritless, drew up in front of a large, newly
built log house, in the rear of which were
three smaller ones. These last were for the
accommodation of the negroes, who were
soon scattering in every direction, in order
to ascertain, as soon as possible, all the conveniences
and inconveniences of their new
home. It took Aunt Dillah but a short time
to make up her mind that “Kentuck was
an ugly-looking, out-of-the way place, the
whole on’t; that she wished to gracious
she’s back in old Virginny;” and lastly,
that “she never should have come, no
how, if marster hadn’t of ’sisted and ’sisted,
till ’twasn’t in natur to ’fuse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This assertion Aunt Dillah repeated so frequently,
that she at length came to believe
it herself. The old creature had no idea that
she was not the main prop of her master’s
household, and we ourselves are inclined to
think that Mrs. Wilder, unaided by Dillah’s
strong arm, ready tact, and encouraging words,
could not well have borne the hardships and
privations attending that home in the wilderness.
Weary and heart-sick, she stepped
from the little waggon, while an expression
of sadness passed over her face as her eye
wandered over the surrounding country,
where tract after tract of thick woodland
stretched on and still onward, to the verge
of the most distant horizon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dillah, better than any one else, understood
how to cheer her mistress, and within
an hour after their arrival a crackling fire
was blazing in the fire-place, while the old
round iron-teakettle, or rather its contents
were hissing and moaning, and telling, as
plainly as tea-kettle could tell, of coming
good cheer. At length the venison steaks
and Dillah’s short cake, smoking hot, were
placed upon the old square table, and the
group which shared that first supper at Glen’s
Creek were, with the exception of Charlie,
comparatively contented. He, poor child,
missed the scenes of his early home, and
more than all, he missed his playmate, Ella.</p>

<p class='c007'>Long after the hour of midnight went by,
he stood by his little low window near the
head of his bed, gazing up at the hosts of
shining stars, and wondering if they were
looking upon his dear old home, even as they
looked down upon him, home-sick and
lonely, afar in the wilderness of Kentucky.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class='large'>ORIANNA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Weeks passed on, and within and without
Deacon Wilder’s doors were signs of life and
civilization. Trees were cut down, gardens
were made, corn and vegetables were
planted, and still no trace of an Indian had
been seen, although Jake had frequently expressed
a wish to get a shot at the “varmin,”
as he called them. Still, he felt that
it would be unwise to be caught out alone
at any very great distance from his master’s
dwelling.</p>

<p class='c007'>This feeling was shared by all of Deacon
Wilder’s household except Charlie, who frequently
went forth alone into the forest
shade, and rambled over the hills where
grew the rich wild strawberry and the fair
summer flowers, and where, too, roamed the
red man; for the Indian was there, jealously
watching each movement of his white
brother, and waiting for some provocation to
strike a deadly blow. But Charlie knew it
not, and fearlessly each day he plunged
deeper and deeper into the depths of the
woods, taking some stately tree or blighted
stump as a way-mark by which to trace his
homeward road, when the shadows began to
grow long and dark.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although he knew it not, Charlie had a
protector, who each day, in the shady woods
and wild gullies of Glen’s Creek, awaited
his coming. Stealthily would she follow his
footsteps, and when on the velvety turf he
laid him down to rest, she would watch near
him, lest harm should befall the young
sleeper. It was Orianna, the only and darling
child of Owanno, the chieftain, whose
wigwam was three miles west of Glen’s
Creek, near a spot called Grassy Spring.</p>

<p class='c007'>Orianna had first been attracted toward
Charlie by seeing him weep one day, and
from a few words which he involuntarily let
fall, she learned that his heart was not with
the scenes wherein he dwelt, but was far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>away toward the “rising sun.” Orianna’s
heart was full of kindly sympathy, and from
the time when she first saw Charlie weeping
in the forest, she made a vow to the Great
Spirit that she would love and protect the
child of the “pale-face.” The vow thus
made by the simple Indian maiden was
never broken, but through weal and woe it
was faithfully kept.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a long time ere Orianna ventured to
introduce herself to her new friend; but
when she did so, she was delighted to find
that he neither expressed fear of her, nor
surprise at her personal appearance. From
that time they were inseparable, although
Orianna exacted from Charlie a promise not
to mention her at home, and also resisted
his entreaties that she would accompany
him thither. In reply to all his arguments,
she would say, mournfully, “No, Charlie,
no; the pale-face is the enemy of my people,
although Orianna never can think they are
enemies to her; and sometimes I have wished—it
was wicked, I know, and the Great
Spirit was angry—but I have wished that I,
too, was of the fair-haired and white-browed
ones.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Charlie’s home there was much wonder
as to what took him so regularly to the
woods but he withstood their questioning
and kept his secret safely. In the wigwam,
too, where Orianna dwelt, there was some
grumbling at her frequent absences, but the
old chieftain Owanno and his wife Narretta
loved their child too well to prohibit her
rambling when and where she pleased. This
old couple were far on the journey of life,
when Orianna came as a sunbeam of gladness
to their lone cabin, and thenceforth
they doted upon her as the miser doats upon
his shining gold.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was a tall, graceful creature of nineteen
or twenty summers, and her life would
have been one of unbounded happiness had
it not been for one circumstance. Near her
father’s wigwam lived the young chief Wahlaga,
who to a most ferocious nature added
a face horridly disfigured by the many fights
in which he had been foremost. A part of
his nose was gone, and one eye entirely so;
yet to this man had Owanno determined to
wed his beautiful daughter, who looked
upon Wahlaga with perfect disgust, and resolved
that, sooner than marry him, she
would perish in the deep waters of the Kentucky,
which lay not many miles away.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.<br> <span class='large'>MARIAN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The deacon and his family had now been
residents at Glen’s Creek nearly three
months. Already was the leafy month of
June verging into sultry July, when George
Wilder at length found time to carry out a
plan long before formed. It was to visit
Marian, and if he found her all which as a
child she had promised to be, he would win
her for himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon after the early sun had touched the
hill tops as with a blaze of fire, George
mounted his favourite steed, and taking Jake
with him for a companion, turned
into the woods and took the
lonely road to Lexington. Leaving
them for a moment, we will press on and
see Marian’s home.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a large, double log building, over
which the flowering honeysuckle and dark
green hop-vine had been trained until they
formed an effectual screen. The yard in
front was large, and much taste had been
displayed in the arrangement of the flowers
and shrubs which were scattered through it.
Several large forests had been left standing,
and at one end of the yard, under a clump
of honey-locusts, a limpid stream of water,
now nearly dry, went dancing over the large
flat limestones which lay at the bottom. In
the rear of the house was the garden, which
was very large, and contained several bordered
walks, grassy plats, and handsome
flower-beds, besides vegetables of all descriptions.
At the end of the garden, and under
the shadows of the woods, was a little summer-house,
over which a wild grape-vine had
been taught to twine its tendrils.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this summer-house, on the morning of
which we are speaking, was a beautiful
young girl, Marian Gorton. We have not
described her, neither do we intend to, for
she was not as beautiful as heroines of stories
usually are; but, reader, we will venture
that she was as handsome as any person you
have ever seen, for people were handsomer
in those days than they are now—at least
our grand-parents tell us so. Neither have
we told her age, although we are sure that
we have somewhere said enough on that
point to have you know, by a little calculation,
that Marian was now eighteen.</p>

<p class='c007'>This morning, as she sits in the summer-house,
her brow is resting on her hand, and a
shadow is resting on her brow. Had Marian
cause for sorrow? None except that her
cousin Robert, who had recently returned
from England, had that morning offered her
his hand and been partially refused. Yet
why should Marian refuse him whom many
a proud lady in the courtly halls of England
would not refuse? Did she remember one
who, years ago, in the green old woods of
Virginia, awakened within her childish heart
a feeling which, though it might have slumbered
since, was still there in all its freshness?
Yes, she did remember him, although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>she struggled hard to conquer each feeling
that was interwoven with a thought of him.
Nearly three months he had been within
twenty miles of her, and yet no word or message
had been received, and Marian’s heart
swelled with resentment toward the young
man, whose fleet steed even then could scarce
keep pace with his master’s eager wishes to
press onward.</p>

<p class='c007'>From her earliest childhood she had looked
upon Robert as a brother, and now that
he was offered as a husband, her heart rebelled,
although pride occasionally whispered,
“Do it,—marry him,—then see what George
Wilder will say;” but Marian had too much
good sense long to listen to the promptings
of pride, and the shadow on her face is occasioned
by a fear that she had remembered so
long and so faithfully only to find herself uncared
for and forgotten.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meantime, the sound of horses’ feet near
her father’s house had brought to the fence
half a dozen negroes and half as many dogs,
all ready in their own way to welcome the
new-comers. After giving his horse in
charge of the negroes, George proceeded to
the house, where he was cordially received
by Mrs. Gorton, who could scarcely recognize
the school-boy George in the tall, fine-looking
young man before her. Almost his first
inquiry was for Marian. Mrs. Gorton did
not know where she was, but old Sukey, who
had known George in Virginia, now hobbled
in, and after a few tears and a great many
“Lor’ bless you’s,” and inquiries about
“old Virginny,” she managed to tell him
that Marian was in the garden, and that she
would call her; but George prevented her,
saying he would go himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of my readers have doubtless either
witnessed or experienced meetings similar
to that which took place between George
and Marian, so I shall not describe it, but
shall leave it for the imagination, which will
probably do it better justice than can my
pen, which comes very near the <i>point</i> of
being used up. We will only say, that when
at twelve o’clock Mr. Gorton and Robert returned
from a ride, George and Marian were
still in the summer-house, unmindful of the
sun which looked in upon them as if to tell
them of his onward course. But then, the
question that morning asked and answered
was of great importance, so ’twas no wonder
they were alike deaf and blind to the little
darkies who on tip-toe crept behind the
summer-house, eager to know “what the
strange gentleman could be saying to Miss
Marian, which made her look so speckled
and roasted like.” These same hopefuls,
when at dinner time they were sent for their
young mistress, commenced a general hunt,
which finally terminated in the popping of
their woolly heads into the summer house
door, exclaiming between breaths, “Oh, Miss
Marian, here you is. We’ve looked for you
everywhar! Come to your dinner.” On
their way to the house they encountered old
Sukey, who called out, “Ho, Mas’ George,—’specs
mebby you found Miss Marry-em,”
at the same time shaking her sides at her
own wit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Gorton received his young friend with
great cordiality, but there was a cool haughtiness
in the reception which Robert at first
gave his old playmate. He suspected the
nature of George’s visit, nor did Marian’s
bright, joyous face tend in the least to allay
his suspicions. But not long could he cherish
feelings of resentment toward one whom
he liked so well as he had George Wilder.
In the course of an hour his reserve wore off,
and unless George should chance to see this
story,—which is doubtful,—he will probably
never know how bitter were the feelings
which his presence for a few moments stirred
in the heart of Robert Hunting. Before
George returned home, he asked Marian of
her father, and also won from her a promise
that, ere the frosts of winter came, her home
should be with him, and by his own fireside.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br> <span class='large'>ROBERT AND ORIANNA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There was much talk and excitement in
Deacon Wilder’s family when it was known
that in a little more than three months’ time
a young maiden would come among them,
who would be at once daughter, sister and
mistress. From Jake, the negroes had received
most of their information, and verily
George himself would scarcely have recognized
Marian in the description given of her
by his servant. So many beauties and
excellences were attributed to her, that the
negroes were all on the <i><span lang="la">qui vive</span></i> to see this
paragon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Charlie, too, was delighted, and when the
next day he as usual met Orianna in the
woods, he led her to a mossy bank, and then
communicated to her the glad tidings. When
he repeated to her the name of his future
sister-in-law, he was greatly surprised
at seeing Orianna start quickly to her feet,
while a wild light flashed from her
large black eyes. Soon reseating herself, she
said, calmly, “What is it, Charlie? What
is the name of the white lady?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Marian—Marian Gorton,” repeated
Charlie. “Do you not think it a pretty
name?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Orianna did not answer, but sat with her
small, delicate hands pressed tightly over
her forehead. For a moment Charlie looked
at her in wonder; then taking both her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>hands in his, he said, gently, “Don’t feel so,
Orianna. I shall love you just as well, even
if I do have a sister Marian.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Orianna’s only answer was, “Say her
name again, Charlie.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He did so, and then Orianna repeated,
“Marian—Marian—what is it? Oh, what
is it? Marian;—it sounds to Orianna like
music heard years and years ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps it was a dream,” suggested
Charlie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It must have been,” answered Orianna,
“but a pleasant dream, fair as the young
moon or the summer flowers. But tell me
more, Charlie.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will do so,” said he, “but I am afraid
you will forget your lesson.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had been in the habit of taking to the
woods some one of his reading books, and in
this way he had unconsciously awakened in
Orianna a desire for learning. For some time
past a part of each day had been spent in
teaching her the alphabet. It was an interesting
sight, that dark, handsome girl, and
the fair, pale boy—he in the capacity of a
patient teacher, and she the ambitious
scholar.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the afternoon of the day of which we
are speaking, they were, as usual, employed
in their daily occupation. The excitement
of the occasion heightened the rich glow on
Orianna’s cheek, while the wreath of white
wild flowers, which Charlie had woven and
placed among her shining black hair, gave
her the appearance of some dark queen of
the forest. The lesson was nearly completed,
and Charlie was overjoyed to find that
his pupil knew every letter, both great and
small, when they were startled by the sound
of a footstep, and in a moment Robert
Hunting, who had accompanied George
Wilder home from Lexington, stood before
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Swiftly as a deer Orianna bounded away,
while Charlie, in evident confusion, attempted
to secrete his book, and Robert burst
into a loud laugh, saying, “Well done,
Charlie! So you’ve turned schoolmaster,
and chosen a novel pupil, upon my word.
But who is she? If she be a native, she is
handsomer far than half the white girls!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is Orianna,” said Charlie, “the
daughter of a chieftain, and I love her too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nobility, hey?” said Robert laughing.
“Better yet. But what made her run so?
Did she think I was the Evil One? Can’t you
call her back?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She won’t come,” answered Charlie;
“she don’t like you, and I can’t make her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So you have been saying a word in my
favour, have you?” said Robert, a little sarcastically.
“Greatly obliged to you, Master
Charlie, but I prefer doing my own pleading.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t mean <i>you</i>,” said Charlie, a little
indignantly. “She don’t know that there
is such a thing as you. I meant all the
white folks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you did,” answered Robert, looking
wistfully in the direction where Orianna had
disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that moment there was the report of a
rifle, and a ball passed between him and
Charlie and lodged in a tree a few feet distant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So he,” exclaimed Robert, “wasn’t content
with sending an arrow at my heart, but
must hurl a bullet at my head.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Charlie was confounded. He never for a
moment doubted that Orianna had sent the
ball, and a fearful distrust of her filled his
heart. A week went by, and still he neglected
to take his accustomed walk, although
he noticed that Robert went daily in his
stead.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length one morning Robert came to
him and said, “Orianna bade me tell you that
each day, ’neath the buckeye tree, she’s
watched for you in vain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Charlie’s eyes opened wide with astonishment,
as he exclaimed, “Orianna? Where
have you seen Orianna?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where should I see her, pray, but in the
woods?” answered Robert. “We have
spent the last five days together there, and
I have taken your place as teacher.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here we may as well explain what the
reader is doubtless anxious to know. The
bullet which passed between Robert and
Charlie was not sent by the hand of Orianna,
but by the vicious Wahlaga, whose
curiosity had been roused as to what led
Orianna so frequently to the woods. On
that day he had followed and discovered her,
just at the moment when Robert appeared
before her. The jealous savage, thinking
that he looked upon his rival, made ready
his gun, when Orianna, suddenly coming
upon him, threw aside his arm, thus changing
the course of the ball, while at the same
time she led the excited Indian away, and
at length succeeded in convincing him that
never before had she seen Robert, nor did
she even know who he was.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning Orianna was overjoyed
to learn that Wahlaga was about leaving
home, to be absent an indefinite length of
time. Her happiness, however was soon
clouded by some expressions which he let fall,
and from which she gathered that her father
had promised to give her in marriage as soon
as he should return. “It shall never be;
no, never,” said the determined girl, as, immediately
after his departure, she took the
narrow footpath to the woods of Glen’s
Creek.</p>

<p class='c007'>Throughout all the morning she waited in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>vain for Charlie, although she several times
saw Robert at a distance, and felt sure that
he was looking for her. She knew that she
had saved his life, and this created in her a
desire to see him again. Accordingly, when
that afternoon they once more came face to
face, she did not run, but eagerly asked after
her young companion. Robert knew well
how to play his part and in a few moments
Orianna’s shyness had vanished, and she was
answering, with ready obedience, all the
questions asked her by the handsome
stranger. Ere they parted, Robert had
learned that to her he owed his life, and as
a token of his gratitude he placed upon her
slender finger a plain gold ring. He did not
ask her to meet him again next day, but he
well knew she would, for she, who knew no
evil, thought no evil.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Robert had said, he took Charlie’s place
as teacher; but, ah me! the lessons thus
taught and received were of a far different
nature from the alphabet in Charlie’s picture-book.
Many a time, ere that week went by,
the simple Indian girl, in the solitude of
night, knelt by the streamlet which ran by
her father’s door, and prayed the Great
Spirit to forgive her for the love which
she bore the white man, the enemy of her
people;—and he?—why he scarce knew himself
what his thoughts and intentions were.
He looked upon Orianna as a simple-minded,
innocent child; and while he took
peculiar delight in studying her character,
he resolved that neither in word nor
deed would he harm the gentle girl who each
day came so timidly to his side.</p>

<p class='c007'>Day after day was his stay at Glen’s Creek
protracted, and yet he would not acknowledge
that even he was interested in her
within whose heart a passion had been
awakened, never more to slumber. The day
on which he spoke to Charlie of Orianna,
was the last which he would spend at Glen’s
Creek, and as he did not wish to be alone
when he bade her adieu, he asked Charlie
to accompany him. Oh, how bright was the
smile with which the maiden greeted them
at first, and how full of despair was the expression
of her face when told by Robert
that he must leave her! Not a word did she
speak, but closely to her heart she pressed
the little Charlie, as if fearful lest he, too,
should go.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Farewell, Orianna,” said Robert.
“When the nuts are brown upon the trees,
look for me, for I shall come again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A moment more, and he was gone,—gone
with poor Orianna’s heart, and left her nothing
in return. Covering her face with her
hands, she wept so long and bitterly, that
Charlie at last wound his arms around her
neck, and wept too, although he knew not for
what. This token of sympathy aroused
her, and after a moment she said, “Leave
me now, Charlie; Orianna would be alone.”
He arose to obey, when she added, “Don’t
tell them,—don’t tell him what you have
seen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He promised secrecy, and Orianna was left
alone. The forest was dark with the shadows
of coming night ere she arose, and then
the heart which she bore back to the wigwam
by Grassy Spring was sadder than any
she had ever before carried across the threshold
of her home. The next day Charlie
noticed a certain listlessness about his pupil,
which he had never observed before; and
though her eye wandered over the printed
page, her thoughts were evidently away. At
last a happy thought struck him, and drawing
close to her, he whispered, “I think
<i>Robert</i> will be pleased if you learn to read.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had touched the right chord—no other
incentive was needed—and from that day
her improvement was as rapid as the most
ambitious teacher could wish. Frequently
she would ask Charlie concerning Marian,
requesting him to repeat her name; then
she would fall into a fit of musing, “When
heard I that name? and where was it?—oh,
where?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Yes, Orianna, <i>Where was it?</i></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br> <span class='large'>THE BRIDAL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Swiftly and on noiseless wing sped on old
Father Time, and they who thought the summer
would never pass, were surprised when
o’er the wooded hills the breath of autumn
came, bearing the yellow leaf—the first
white hair in nature’s sunny locks. The
golden harvests were gathered in, and
through the forest “the sound of dropping
nuts was heard,” showing that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The melancholy days had come,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The saddest of the year.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was the last day of October, and over
the fading earth the autumnal sun was shedding
its rays as brightly as in the early summer.
The long shadows, stretching far to the
eastward, betokened approach of night, and
when at last the sun sank to its western
home, the full moon poured a flood of soft,
pale light over the scene, and looking in at
a half-opened window, shone upon a beautiful
young girl, who, with the love-light in
her dark-blue eye, and woman’s holy trust
in her heart, was listening, or seeming to
listen, while the words were said which
made her the wife of George Wilder.</p>

<p class='c007'>Scarce was the ceremony completed, when
the light from the window was obscured, a
shadow fell darkly upon Robert, and a
voice, clear and musical, uttered words
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>which curdled the blood of the fair bride,
and made more than one heart stand still
with fear. They were, “<i>The Indians! the
Indians!</i>—they are coming in less than an
hour!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The next moment a tall and graceful figure
appeared in the doorway, and laying its
hand on Robert’s shoulder, exclaimed, “It
is <i>your</i> life they seek, but Orianna will save
you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then away glided the maiden, so noiselessly
that but for the tidings she brought,
the party would almost have doubted that
she had been there. For a time the company
were mute with surprise, and involuntarily
George clasped closely to his side his
Marian, as if to shield her from the coming
danger. At length, Mr. Gorton asked Robert
for an explanation of what the stranger
had said.</p>

<p class='c007'>Robert replied, “Two days since, I was
hunting in the woods not far from the house,
when a rustling noise behind some bushes attracted
my attention. Without stopping to
think, I levelled my gun and fired, when
behold! up sprang an Indian girl, and
bounded away so swiftly that to overtake
her and apologize was impossible. This I
suppose to be the reason why my life is
sought.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His supposition was correct, and for the
benefit of the reader we will explain how
Orianna became possessed of the secret. The
night before, when returning to her father’s
wigwam, she was startled by the sound of
many voices within. Curiosity prompted
her to listen, and she thus learned that the
Indians who lived east of Lexington had
been insulted by a white man, who had fired
at one of their squaws. From the description
of the aggressor, she knew it to be
Robert, and with fast beating heart she
listened to the plan of attacking Mr. Gorton’s
dwelling on the night of the wedding.</p>

<p class='c007'>Owanno heard them to the end, and then,
to Orianna’s great delight, he refused to
join them, saying he was too old to contend
with the pale-face unless himself or family
were molested. The old chief would not
acknowledge how much this decision was
owing to the influence of his gentle daughter.
He knew she liked the whites, and he
knew, too, another thing—but ’tis not time
for that yet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Orianna had now something to do. A
life dearer far than her own was to be saved,
and Marian, too,—whose very name had a
power to thrill each nerve of that noble Indian
girl,—she was in danger.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day Charlie waited in vain for
his pupil, for she was away on her mission
of love, and the stern features of many an
Indian relaxed as he welcomed to his cabin
the chieftain’s daughter. Ere the sun set,
she fully understood their plan of attack,
and then, unmindful of the twenty-five
miles traversed since the dawn of day, she
hied her back to Lexington, to raise its inhabitants,
and, as we have seen, to apprise
the bridal party of their danger.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not a moment was to be lost, and while
they were consulting as to their best means
of safety, the Indian girl again stood
among them, saying, “Let me advise
you. It is not the town they
wish to attack,—they will hardly
do that—it is <i>this</i> house—it is <i>you</i>,” laying
her hand convulsively on Robert’s arm.
“But there is yet time to escape; flee to the
town, and leave me here—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To be killed?” said Robert.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To be killed!” she repeated, scornfully.
“In all Kentucky there lives not the red
man who dares touch a hair of Orianna’s
head.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her proposition seemed feasible enough,
and after a little hesitation it was resolved
to adopt it. The negroes had already done
so, for at the first alarm they had taken to
their heels, and were by this time half way
to Lexington. Thither the whites, with the
exception of Robert, soon followed. He
resolutely refused to go, saying, in answer to
his friends entreaties, “No, never will I
desert a helpless female. You remove the
ladies to a place of safety, and then with
others return to my aid.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So they were left alone, the white man
and the Indian. Together, side by side,
they watched the coming of the foe. At
Orianna’s direction the doors had been barricaded,
while the lights were left burning
in order to deceive the Indians into a belief
that the inmates still were there. A half
hour went by, and then, in tones which sent
the blood in icy streams through Robert’s
veins, Orianna whispered, “They come!
Do you see them? Look!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He did look, and by the light of the moon
he discerned the outlines of many dusky
forms, moving stealthily through the woods
in the direction of the house. The garden
fence was passed, and then onward, slowly
but surely, they came. So intent was
Robert in watching their movements, that
he noted not the band of armed men who,
in an opposite direction, were advancing to
the rescue; neither did he observe in time to
prevent it the lightning spring with which
Orianna bounded through the window, and
went forth to meet the enemy, who, mistaking
her for some one else, uttered a yell of
savage exultation and pressed on more fiercely.
Loud and deafening was the war-cry
which echoed through the woods, and louder
still was the shout of defiance which rent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>the air, as the whites came suddenly face to
face with the astonished Indians.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was Orianna’s intention, when she
leaped from the window, to reach the leader
of the savages, and by telling him the truth
of the matter as she had heard it from
Robert, she hoped to dissuade him from his
murderous design. But her interference
was not needed, for the savages were surprised
and intimidated by the unexpected
resistance, and in the fear and confusion of
the moment they greatly magnified the number
of their assailants. Accordingly, after a
few random shots, they precipitately fled,
leaving Orianna alone with those whose
lives she had saved.</p>

<p class='c007'>Almost caressingly Robert wound his
arm about her slight form, as he said,
“Twice have you saved my life. Now,
name your reward, and if money—”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was bitterness in the tone with
which Orianna interrupted him, saying,
“Money! Orianna never works for money.
All she asks is that you let her go, for the
path is long which she must tread ere the
sun’s rising.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To-night! You will not leave us to-night!”
said Robert.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Urge me not,” answered Orianna, “for
by the wigwam door at Grassy Spring Narretta
waits, and wonders why I linger.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Remonstrance was useless; for even while
Robert was speaking she moved away, and
the echo of her footfall was scarcely
heard, so rapid and cat-like was the tread
with which she disappeared in the darkness
of the woods. Robert looked thoughtfully
after her for a time, and then, with something
very like a half-smothered sigh, he
turned away. Could that sigh, faint as it
was, have fallen on the ear of the lone
Indian girl, she would have felt fully repaid
for her toil, but now a weight of sorrow lay
upon her young heart, crushing each flower
of gladness, even as she, with impatient
tread, crushed beneath her feet the yellow
leaves of autumn.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br> <span class='large'>ORIANNA’S FAITH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Long had the old square table, with its
cloth of snowy whiteness and its load of eatables,
waited the coming of the bridal party.
Many times had Mrs. Wilder stood in the
doorway, and strained her eyes to catch a
sight of the expected company, and more
than many times had old Dillah declared
“that the corn cake which riz so nice would
be fell as flat as a pewter platter, if they did
not come along.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At length, from the top of a large old
maple, in whose boughs several young Africans
were safely ensconced, there came the
joyful cry of “There, they’s comin’. That’s
the new miss with the tail of her dress floppin’
round the horses’ heels. Jimminy! ain’t
she a tall one!” and the youngsters dropped
to the ground, and perched themselves, some
on the fence and others on the gate, with
eyes and mouth open to whatever might
happen.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the doorway Mrs. Wilder received the
bride, and the ready tears gushed forth as
for the first time in her life she folded to
her heart a daughter. From his stool in
the corner, Charlie came, and throwing his
arms around Marian’s neck, he said, “I
know I shall love you, for you look so
much like Orianna!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Dillah, who was pressing forward to
offer her congratulations, was so much surprised
that she forgot the bow and fine
speech which, for more than a week, she had
been practising. Her command of language,
however, did not wholly desert her, for she
said, somewhat warmly, “Clar for ’t, Master
Charles, young miss won’t feel much sot up
to be told she favours a black Injun.”</p>

<p class='c007'>George, too, was evidently piqued at having
his bride likened to an Indian, but Robert
came to Charlie’s relief, saying that “he
had often noticed how wholly unlike an
Indian were the features of Orianna, and that
were her skin a few shades lighter, she would
be far more beautiful than many pale-cheeked
belles, with their golden curls and snowy
brows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The conversation now turned upon Orianna,
and the strong affection which existed
between her and Charlie, whom Robert teased
unmercifully about his “dark-eyed ladye
love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Charlie bore it manfully, and ere the evening
was spent, he had promised to take
Marian with him next time he visited his Indian
friend. This promise he fulfilled, and the
meeting between the two girls was perfectly
simple and natural. Both were prepared to
like each other, and both looked curiously,
one at the other, although Marian at last
became uneasy at the deep, earnest gaze
which those full, black eyes bent upon her,
while their owner occasionally whispered,
“Marian, Marian.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Visions of sorcery and witchcraft
passed before her mind, and still,
turn which way she would, she felt that
the dark girl’s eyes were fixed upon her with
a strangely fascinating look. But fear not,
young Marian, for though she strokes your
silken curls, and caressingly touches your
soft cheek, the forest maiden will do you no
harm. At length Marian’s timidity gave
way, and when she arose to go, she did not
refuse her hand to Orianna, who for a time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>kept it between her own, as if admiring its
whiteness; then suddenly throwing it from
her, she said, “Oh, why can’t Orianna be
white and handsome, too?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are handsome,” answered Marian.
“Only two evenings since I heard Robert
Hunting say that you were far more beautiful
than half the white girls.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who takes my name in vain?” said a
musical voice, as Robert himself appeared
before them, and laid his hand gently upon
Orianna’s glossy hair.</p>

<p class='c007'>If Marian had any doubts of her beauty
before, they were now dispelled by the rich
colour which mounted to her olive cheek,
and the joy which danced in her large eye.
Yet ’twas not Robert’s presence alone which
so delighted Orianna. A ray of hope had
entered her heart. “He thought her beautiful,
and perhaps—perhaps—”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ah, Orianna, think not that Robert Hunting
will ever wed an Indian, for Robert is
no Rolfe, and you no Pocahontas!</p>

<p class='c007'>As if divining and giving words to her
thoughts, Robert, while seating himself
between the two girls, and placing an arm
around each, said, playfully, “Hang it all,
Orianna, why were you not white!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t, Bob,” whispered Marian, who
with woman’s quick perception half suspected
the nature of Orianna’s feelings for one
whose life she twice had saved.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t what, my little Puritan?” asked
Robert.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t raise hopes which you <i>know</i> can
never be realized,” answered Marian.</p>

<p class='c007'>Robert was silent for a while, and then
said, “I reckon my orthodox cousin is right;”
then turning to Orianna, he asked how her
reading progressed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Charlie answered for her, saying that she
could read in words of one syllable as well
as any one, and that she knew a great
deal besides! Robert was about testing
her powers of scholarship, when they were
joined by George Wilder, before whom Orianna
absolutely refused to open her mouth, and
in a few moments she arose and left them,
saying, “I shall come again to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That night, by the wigwam fire, Narretta
was listening to her daughter’s account of
the “white dove,” as she called Marian.
Suddenly a light seemed to dawn on Orianna’s
mind, and clasping her hands together
she said, “Mother, do you remember when
I was sick, many, many moons ago?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, child,” answered Narretta, and
Orianna continued: “I slept a long time, I
knew, but when I woke, I remember that
you, or some one else, said, “She is getting
white; it will never do.” Then I looked at
my hands, and they were almost as fair as
Marian’s, but you washed me with something,
and I was dark again. Tell me,
mother, was I turning white?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Turning white!</i> No child,” said Narretta;
“now shut up and get to bed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Orianna obeyed, but she could not sleep,
and about midnight she stole out at the door,
and going to the spring, for more than half
an hour she bathed her face and hands,
hoping to wash off the offensive colour. But
all her efforts were vain, and then on the
withered leaves she knelt, and prayed to the
white man’s God,—the God who, Charlie had
said, could do everything. “Make Orianna
white, make her white,” were
the only words she uttered, but around
her heart there gathered confidence
that her prayer would be answered, and impatiently
she waited for the morrow’s
light.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother, am I white?” aroused Narretta
from her slumbers, just as the first sunlight
fell across the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“White! No; blacker than ever,” was
the gruff answer, and Orianna’s faith in
“Charlie’s God” was shaken.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI.<br> <span class='large'>PREPARATIONS FOR A JOURNEY.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O’er the forest dark and lonely,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Death’s broad wing is brooding now,</div>
      <div class='line'>While each day the shadow deepens</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Over Charlie’s fevered brow.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Charlie’s health, which had always been
delicate, seemed much impaired by the
Kentucky air but with the return of winter,
there came the hacking cough and darting
pain, and Orianna already foresaw the time
when, with a flood of bitter tears, she would
lay her darling in the grave. The meetings
in the woods were given up, and if Orianna
saw her pet at all, it was in his home, where
she at length became a regular visitor, and
where Marian daily taught her as Charlie
had before done. Many were the lessons
learned in the sick-room where Charlie lay,
fading day by day, and many were the talks
which he had with his Indian friend concerning
the God whose power she questioned.
But from the time when she was able herself
to read in Charlie’s Bible, the light of
truth slowly broke over her darkened mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the commencement of Charlie’s illness,
he looked upon death as sure, and
his young heart went back to his playmate,
Ella, with earnest longings, which vented
themselves in pleadings that some one would
go for her,—would bring her to him and let
him look upon her once more ere he died.
’Twas in vain that his mother tried to convince
him of the impossibility of such a
thing. He would only answer, “I shall
not know her in heaven, unless I see her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>again, for I have almost forgotten how she
looked.”</p>

<hr class='c010'>

<p class='c007'>Winter was gone, and Charlie, no longer
able to sit up, lay each day in his bed, talking
of heaven and Ella, whom he now scarcely
hoped to see again. One afternoon Orianna
lingered longer than usual, in low, earnest
conversation with the sufferer. Charlie listened
eagerly to what she was saying, while
his eye sparkled and his fading cheek glowed
as with the infusion of new life. As she
was about leaving she whispered, softly,
“Never fear, though the time be long, I will
surely bring her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Yes, Orianna had resolved to go alone
through the wilderness to Virginia, and
bring to the dying boy the little Ella.
Filled with this idea she hastened home; but
list,—whose voice is it that on the threshold
of her father’s door makes her quake with
fear? Ah, Orianna knows full well that ’tis
Wahlaga! He has returned to claim his
bride, and instantly visions of the pale,
dying Charlie, the far off Ella, and of one,
too, whose name she scarcely dared breathe,
rose before her, as in mute agony she leaned
against the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>But her thoughts soon resolved themselves
into one fixed determination—“I will never
marry him;” and then with a firm
step she entered the cabin. Wahlaga
must have guessed her feelings, for he greeted
her moodily, and immediately left her with
her parents. To her father, she instantly
confided her plan of going for Ella, and as
she had expected, he sternly forbade it, saying
she should stay and marry Wahlaga.</p>

<p class='c007'>Owanno was surprised at the decided
manner with which Orianna replied, “Never,
father, never. I will die in the deep river
first.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this juncture Wahlaga entered, and
the discussion grew warmer and more earnest.
Words more angry the chieftain
spoke to his daughter than ever before
he had done. Suddenly his manner softened,
and concerning her going for Ella, he said,
“If you marry Wahlaga, you can go; otherwise
you cannot, unless you run away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And if she does that,” fiercely continued
Wahlaga, “I swear by the Great Spirit, I’ll
never rest until I’ve shed the blood of every
pale face in that nest—sick whining boy and
all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Like one benumbed by some great and
sudden calamity, Orianna stood speechless,
until her father asked, “Will you go?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, rousing herself, she said, “I cannot
answer now; wait till to-morrow.” Then
forth from the cabin she went, and onward
through the fast deepening twilight she fled,
until through an opening in the trees she
espied the light which gleamed from Charlie’s
sick-room. Softly approaching the window,
she looked in and saw a sight which stopped
for a moment the tumultuous beatings of her
heart, and wrung from her a shriek of
anguish. Supported by pillows lay Charlie,
panting for breath, while from his white lips
issued drops of blood, which Marian gently
wiped away, while the rest of the family
were doing what they could to restore him.
When Orianna’s loud cry of agony echoed
through the room, Charlie slowly unclosed
his eyes, and in an instant the Indian
girl was beside him, exclaiming wildly,
“Charlie, Charlie, do not die. I’ll marry
him, I’ll go for her, I’ll do anything.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The astonished family at length succeeded
in pacifying her, by telling her that Charlie
had, in a fit of coughing, ruptured a blood-vessel,
but there was no immediate danger if
she would keep quiet. Quickly the great
agony of her heart was hushed, and silently
she stood by the bedside; nor did they who
looked on her calm face once dream of the
tornado within, or how like daggers were the
words of Charlie, who, in his disturbed sleep,
occasionally murmured, “Ella,—oh, Ella,—has
Orianna gone?—she said she would.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly turning to Marian, Orianna, with
a pressure of the hand almost crushing, said,
“Tell me what to do;” and from the little
cot, Charlie all unconsciously answered,
“Go for Ella.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will,” said Orianna, and ere Marian
had recovered from her astonishment, she
was gone. When alone in the forest, she at
first resolved to start directly for Virginia,
but the remembrance of Wahlaga’s threat
prevented her, and then again in the stilly
night the heroic girl knelt and asked of
Charlie’s God what she would do.</p>

<p class='c007'>Owanno was surprised when, at a late hour
that night, Orianna returned, and expressed
her willingness to marry Wahlaga on condition
that she should first go for Ella, and
that he should not follow her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What proof have we that you will return?”
asked Wahlaga, who was present.</p>

<p class='c007'>Orianna’s lip curled haughtily as she
answered, “Orianna has never yet broke her
word.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The tomahawk and death to those you
love, if you fail in coming,” continued the
savage, and “Be it so,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Narretta with streaming eyes would
fain have interposed a word for her beloved
child, but aught from her would have been
unavailing. So on the poor girl’s head, which
drooped heavily upon her lap, she laid her
hard, withered hands, and her tears fell
soothingly on the troubled heart of one who
stood in so much need of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the coming of daylight Orianna departed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Narretta accompanied her a short
distance, and learned from her how much
more than her life she loved the white man,
and that were it not for this, not half so
terrible would be her marriage with Wahlaga.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would help you if I could,” said Narretta,
“but I cannot, though each night I
will ask the Great Spirit to take care of
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So they parted, Narretta to return to her
lone cabin, and Orianna to pursue her way,
she scarce knew whither. For many days they
missed her in the sick-room, where all but
Charlie wondered why she tarried, and he
finally succeeded in convincing them that she
had really gone for Ella, though at what a
fearful sacrifice he knew not.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.<br> <span class='large'>ELLA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The town of P—— is almost exactly east
of Glen’s Creek, and by keeping constantly
in that direction, Orianna had but little difficulty
in finding her way. In twelve days’
time she accomplished her journey, stopping
for food and lodging at the numerous wigwams
which lay on her road.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was near the middle of the afternoon
when, at last, she entered the woods on the
borders of which lay the settlement of P——.
Wearied with her day’s toil, she sought a
resting-place beneath the same old oak
where, seventeen years before, Mr. Gorton
had laid his little Madeline; and the same
large, rough stone which he had placed there
to mark the spot, and which had since fallen
down, now served her for a seat. But Orianna
knew it not, nor ever dreamed that
often had Robert and Marian stood there,
the one listening tearfully, while the other
told her all he could remember of the sister
who, in childish playfulness, he had often
called his little wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was now near the 1st of April, and already
had the forest trees put forth many a
dark green leaflet, while the song birds gaily
carolled of the coming summer; but Orianna
did not hear them. Sadly her heart went
back to her home, and what there awaited
her. Weary and worn, is it not strange that
for a time she yielded to the despair which
had gathered about her heart? Covering her
face with her hands, she wept bitterly, nor
until twice repeated did she hear the words,
“What makes you cry so?” uttered in the
soft tones of childhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Looking up, she saw before her a little girl,
her deep blue eyes filled with wonder and
her tiny hands filled with the wild flowers of
spring.</p>

<p class='c007'>Something whispered to Orianna that it
was Ella, and brushing away her tears, she
answered, “Orianna is tired, for she has
come a long way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What have you come for?” asked the
child.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Charlie sent me. Do you know Charlie?”
and Orianna looked earnestly at the little
girl, whose blue eyes opened wider, and
whose tiny hands dropped the flowers, as she
answered, “Charlie, my cousin Charlie?
Have you come from him? What word did
he send me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Walk with me and I will tell you,” said
Orianna, rising and taking by the hand the
unresisting child, who with the ready instinct
of childhood, could discriminate between
a friend and foe.</p>

<p class='c007'>For more than an hour, they walked
rapidly on, Ella, in her eagerness to hear
from Charlie, never once thinking how fast
the distance between herself and her home
was increasing; nor had she a thought of
her companion’s intention, until Orianna,
suddenly lifting her in her arms, said, “I
promised Charlie I would bring you, and
for that have I come.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then a cry of fear burst from Ella, who
struggled vainly to escape from the arms
which gently, but tightly, held her. “Let
me go, oh, please let me go,” she cried, us
Orianna’s walk quickened into a run; but
Orianna only replied, “I told Charlie I
would bring you, and I promise you shall
not be hurt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother, oh, mother, who will tell my
mother?” asked Ella.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will send some one to her in the morning,”
answered Orianna; and then in order
to soothe the excited child, she commenced
narrating anecdotes of Charlie and the
place to which they were going.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finding it impossible to escape, Ella by
degrees grew calm, and as the night closed
in, she fell asleep in the arms of Orianna, who
with almost superhuman efforts, sped on
until a wigwam was reached. There for a
short time she rested, and won from a
young Indian a promise that he would next
morning acquaint Capt. Wilder of the whereabouts
of his child. Fearing pursuit, she
could not be prevailed upon to stay all night,
but started forward, still keeping in her
arms the little Ella, who at last slept as
soundly as ever she had done in her soft bed
at home.</p>

<p class='c007'>The night was far spent when Orianna
finally stopped beneath the shelter of a large,
overhanging rock. The movement aroused
Ella, who, instantly comprehending where
she was, again pleaded earnestly that she
might go home. Orianna soon convinced
her that to return alone was impossible, and
then painted the meeting between herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and Charlie so glowingly that though her
eyes were full of tears, her voice was more
cheerful as she asked, “And will you surely
bring me back?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As yonder stars fade in the rising sun,
so surely shall you go home,” said Orianna.
Then spreading in her lap the blanket
which, with ready forethought, she had
brought from home, she bade Ella lie down
and sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And will you keep the bad Indians off?”
asked Ella, looking shudderingly around at
the dark woods.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No one will harm you while I am here,”
was Orianna’s reply, and with the trusting
faith of childhood Ella, was soon fast asleep,
while Orianna carefully watched her slumbers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once during her night vigils she was
startled by the distant cry of some wild
beast, but it came not near, and the morning
found them both unharmed. Dividing
with her little charge the corn bread and
cold venison which had been procured at the
wigwam, Orianna again set forward, leading
Ella by the hand, and beguiling the hours in
every possible way. The next night they
passed in a wigwam, where dusky faces bent
curiously above the “pale flower” as she
slept, and where, next morning, in addition
to the bountiful supply of corn cake and
venison, a bunch of spring violets was presented
to Ella by an Indian boy, who had
gathered them expressly for the “white
pappoose,” as he called her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Blest season of childhood, which gathers
around it so many who are ready to smooth
the rough places and pluck the sharp thorns
which he so thickly scattered on life’s pathway!
It was Ella’s talisman; for more
than one tall Indian, on learning her history
from Orianna, cheerfully lent a hand, and on
his brawny shoulders carried her from the
sun’s rising to its going down.</p>

<p class='c007'>With Ella for a companion, Orianna proceeded
but slowly, and nearly three weeks
were spent ere familiar way-marks told her
that they were nearing Lexington. “In
less than two days we shall be there,” she
said to Ella, as at the close of one day they
drew near that town.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lighter grew Ella’s footsteps, and brighter
was her eye, while darker and deeper grew
the shadows around poor Orianna. She was
right in her calculations, for on the afternoon
of the second day they struck into the
narrow footpath which led to Deacon
Wilder’s house, and which she and Charlie
oft had trodden.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here for a time we will leave them, while
in another chapter we will read what has
taken place since we in the wilderness have
been roaming.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII.<br> <span class='large'>THE DEATH BED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Anxiously, as the sun was going down, did
Mrs. Wilder watch from her window for the
return of her daughter, and as the gray
twilight deepened into night, and still she
came not, the whole household was alarmed,
and every house in the settlement was
visited, to learn, if possible, some tidings of
the wanderer. Some remembered having
seen her enter the woods soon after dinner,
but farther than that none could tell; and the
loud, shrill cry of “Lost! Lost! A child lost
in the woods!” echoed on the evening air,
and brought from a distance many who joined
in the unsuccessful search, which lasted
all night. Morning came, and Mrs. Wilder,
pale and distracted with grief, ran hither
and thither, calling loudly for her lost darling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three hours of the sun’s daily journey was
accomplished, when a young Indian was seen
to emerge from the woods, and rapidly approach
the house of Capt. Wilder, where
he communicated all he knew concerning
Orianna, and ended his narrative by saying,
“It will be useless to follow her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Capt. Wilder did not think so, and
instantly mounting his horse, he started in
pursuit; but the path he took was entirely
different from the one chosen by Orianna,
and at nightfall he returned home, weary
and discouraged. For some time he had
been contemplating a visit to his brother,
and he now resolved to do so, hoping by
this means to fall in with the fugitives.
Mrs. Wilder warmly approved the plan, but
made him promise that if no good news were
heard of Ella, he would instantly return.</p>

<p class='c007'>Taking with him two negroes, he started
on his journey, but no trace of Orianna did
he discover, and he reached Glen’s Creek before
she had accomplished half the distance.
Assured by his brother’s family of Ella’s
perfect safety with the Indian girl, he grew
calm, although he impatiently waited their
coming.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meantime little Charlie had grown worse,
until at last he ceased to speak of Ella,
although he confidently expected to see her,
and requested that his bed might be moved to
a position from which he could discern the
path which led up from the woods. There for
many days he watched, and then turning
sadly away, he said, “Mother, now take me
back. Ella will come, but I shall be dead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From that time he grew worse, and the
afternoon on which we left Orianna and Ella
in the woods was the last he ever saw on
earth. Gathered around the dying boy
were weeping friends, who knew that the
mild spring sun which so gently kissed his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>cold, pale brow, would never rise again for
him. Kind words he had spoken to all, and
then in a faint whisper, he said, “Tell Ella
——;” but the sentence was unfinished, for
Ella stood before him, while the look of joy
that lighted up his face told how dear to
him was the little girl around whose neck
his arms twined so lovingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now a darker face, but no less loving
heart approached, and whispered softly,
“Charlie, do you know me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Orianna,” was the answer, as on her lips
a kiss was pressed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the arms unclasped from Ella’s neck,
over the blue eyes the heavy eyelids closed,
and Charlie had gone home. With a bitter
wail of sorrow Orianna bent for a moment
over the marble form, for which she had
sacrificed so much, and then, from among
those who fain would have detained her, she
went, nor paused a moment until the wigwam
of her father was reached.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the doorway she found Narretta,
whose first exclamation was, “Have you
heard! Have they told you? The Great
Spirit has answered my prayer!” and then
to her daughter she unfolded a tale which
we, too, will narrate to our readers.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be remembered that on the day
when Orianna left home for Virginia, Narretta
accompanied her a short distance, and
learned from her the story of her love for
Robert. To that story there was another—an
unobserved listener—Wahlaga, who from
that hour resolved to take the life of his
pale rival, but his designs were foiled by a
summons from the invisible world, which he
could not disobey.</p>

<p class='c007'>A week after Orianna’s departure, he was
taken ill of a disease contracted at the Indian
camp, where he had spent the winter.
All the skill of the “medicine man” could
not save him, and on the fifth day he died,
cursing, with his last breath, his hated rival.</p>

<p class='c007'>When it was known at Deacon Wilder’s
that death had been at Grassy Spring, words
of kindly sympathy were sent there for the
sake of the noble Orianna; and for her sake,
perhaps, Owanno’s feelings softened toward
the inhabitants of Glen’s Creek. It is impossible
to describe Orianna’s feelings on
learning that the dreadful Wahlaga was
dead, really dead, and would trouble her no
more. Her whole being seemed changed,
and the slumber which that night stole over
her was sweeter far and more refreshing
than for many weary days had visited her.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Glen’s Creek that same night Capt.
Wilder, with his darling Ella pressed to his
bosom, was listening, while between her
tears for little Charlie, she told him of the
many virtues of her Indian companion, urging
him to send for her mother, that she, too,
might know and love Orianna. But Ella’s
strength was exhausted long before her
theme, and when, as her voice ceased, her
father looked down upon her, she was far in
the depths of dreamland.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV.<br> <span class='large'>THE DENOUEMENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>As if to mock the anguish of those who
were about to lay their last-born in the earth,
the day of Charlie’s funeral was bright and
beautiful, as the spring days often are ’neath
the warm Kentucky sun. Sweetly the wild
flowers were blooming, and merrily sang the
summer birds, as underneath a maple tree, a
tree which stands there yet, they dug that
little grave—the first grave at Glen’s Creek.
Mr. and Mrs. Gorton, Robert, and several
others from Lexington had come to shed the
sympathizing tear with the bereaved ones,
but besides the nearest relatives, there was
not so sincere a mourner as she who, apart
from the rest, looked silently on, while into
the earth they lowered the cold, dead
Charlie.</p>

<p class='c007'>Long after the mourners had returned to
their desolate home, she lingered, and on the
little mound deplored in piteous tones her
loss, saying, “Oh, woe is me, now Charlie
has crossed the great river, and left Orianna
all alone. Who will love me now as he
did?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Many, many,” answered Robert Hunting,
who purposely had returned, and been an
eye and ear witness of Orianna’s grief. “Yes,
many will love you,” he continued, seating
himself by her, and drawing her closely to
him. Then in the bewildered girl’s ear he
softly whispered, “I am not worthy of you,
Orianna, but I love you, and I know, too,
on what condition you went to Virginia,
and that had Wahlaga lived, he had sworn
to murder me and marry you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For this information he was indebted to
Narretta, who, three days before Wahlaga’s
illness, overhearing him unfold his plan of
revenge to Owanno, went to the door of
Deacon Wilder’s house, and asking for
Robert, led him to the woods, and there communicated
to him what he had just told
Orianna. Robert did not ask Orianna to be
his wife; and perhaps ’twas well that he
did not, for the confession which he did make,
added to the excitement of Wahlaga’s and
Charlie’s death, was too much for a frame
already weakened by the hardships attending
that journey to and from Virginia. The
next morning found her burning with fever
and raving with delirium. Owanno, too,
was smitten by the same disease which had
consigned Wahlaga to an early grave.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>With anxious heart Narretta hurried from
one sufferer to the other, and the first Indian
that looked at the door, was urged
to go immediately to Deacon Wilder’s and
ask some one to come to her. Robert and
Marian instantly obeyed the summons, but
human skill could not save Owanno. In
three days after the commencement of his
illness, it was said of him that he had gone
to the fair hunting grounds, while the despairing
howl of the assembled Indians
mingled with the mournful wail of the
widowed Narretta and the feeble moans of
Orianna, who incessantly cried, “Bury me
under the maple tree with Charlie, where we
sat when he told me—where he told me——”
but what he told her she never said.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Marian’s request, Mrs. Gorton had remained
for some time at Glen’s Creek, and
one day, not long after Owanno’s burial, she
accompanied her daughter to see Orianna,
who, though very weak, was still much better.
They found her asleep, but Narretta
arose to receive them. As Mrs. Gorton’s eye
fell upon her, an undefined remembrance of
something past and gone rose before her,
and at last, taking the old Indian woman’s
hand, she said, “Narretta, have I never met
you before?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Plenty times,” was the laconic answer;
and after a moment’s pause, Mrs. Gorton
continued: “I remember now, eighteen or
twenty years ago your wigwam was near my
home in Virginia, and you one morning
came to me, saying you were going away toward
the setting sun.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“White woman remembers wonderful,”
said old Narretta.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I might not remember so well,” answered
Mrs. Gorton, “but you loved my little Madeline,
and about the time you went away
she died.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Something out of doors attracted Narretta’s
attention, and she abruptly turned
away. For more than an hour she was gone,
and when she returned she was muttering to
herself, “Yes, I’ll do it. I shall do it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do what?” asked Marian, a little
alarmed at Narretta’s excited manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Narretta made her no answer, and going
up to Mrs. Gorton, said rapidly, “Madeline
did not die! Narretta loved her, loved
all children, but the Great Spirit gave her
no pappooses of her own, and when she
went away she stole her. She took her, and
under the tree she left part of her clothing
and the smashed carcass of a young fawn, to
make the white woman think the wolves had
eaten her up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here she stopped, and Mrs. Gorton, grasping
the wasted hand of Orianna, turned to
Narretta and said, “Tell me, tell me
truly, if this be Madeline, my long-lost
daughter!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is!” answered Narretta. “You
know she was never so fair as the other
one,” pointing to Marian, “and with a
wash of roots which I made, she grew still
blacker.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She might have added, also, that constant
exposure to the weather had rendered still
darker Orianna’s complexion, which was
naturally a rich brunette. But whatever
else she might have said was prevented by
Mrs. Gorton, who fell in a death-like swoon
at her feet. The shock was too great, to
know that in the gentle Orianna, whose
noble conduct had won the love of so many
hearts, she beheld her long-wept-for daughter
Madeline.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon Marian and Orianna the knowledge
that they were sisters operated differently,
according to their different temperaments.
With a cry of joy Marian threw her arms
around Orianna’s neck, who, when made to
comprehend the reality, burst into tears,
saying, “I thought I should be white sometime—I
almost knew I should.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By this time Mrs. Gorton had recovered
from her fainting fit, and clasping her newly
found daughter to her bosom, thanked the
God who so unexpectedly had restored her.
The next day the news reached Lexington,
bringing thence Robert, who, in the intensity
of his joy, seemed hardly sane. At a
glance he foresaw the future. Orianna, for
so he would always call her, should go to
school for five years, and at the end of that
time, images of a noble, beautiful bride rose
before him, as he hurriedly traversed the
road to Grassy Spring. Their interview we
shall not describe, for no one witnessed it,
though Marian impatiently remarked that
“it took Bob much longer to tell what he had
to say than it did George when he first came
to Lexington.” But then Marian had
forgotten, as who will not forget, or pretend
to.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Narretta was the only one who seemed
not to share the general joy. She looked
upon Orianna as lost to her for ever, and
heard the plan of sending her to school with
unfeigned sorrow. Still, she made no
objections to whatever Mr. and Mrs.
Gorton chose to do with their child:
and when Orianna was well enough,
she gave her consent that she should be
removed to her father’s house, where
every possible indulgence was lavished upon
her by her parents, in order to attach her to
them and their mode of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was now no tie to bind Narretta to
Grassy Spring, and yielding to Orianna’s
entreaties, she accompanied her to Lexington,
occupying a cabin which Mr. Gorton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>built for her on the edge of the wood at the
foot of the garden. Here, many times a
day, she saw her child, who was now
Robert’s daily pupil. But Robert found it
more difficult to tame his Indian girl than
he had at first anticipated. On one subject—that
of dress—she for a time seemed
incorrigible. Occasionally she would assume
the style worn by Marian, but soon casting
it off, she would don her old costume, in
which she felt and looked most at home.
But one day the Indian dress mysteriously
disappeared. More than a week Orianna
sought for it in vain; then, with a flood of
tears, she yielded the point, and wore whatever
her friends thought proper. Her complexion,
too, with which great pains was
taken, gradually grew fair, until all trace of
the walnut stain disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>In October she was placed in the best
school of which Philadelphia could then
boast. She was always shy and timid, but
her gentle manners and sweet disposition, to
say nothing of the romance connected with
her history, made her a general favourite
with her companions, while the eagerness
with which she sought for knowledge rendered
her equally a favourite with her
teachers. In speaking of this once to her
mother, who was visiting her, she said,
“When dear Charlie died, I thought there
was no one left to love me, but now it seems
that every body loves me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here we will say a word concerning little
Ella, who, two days after Charlie’s funeral,
had gone home with her father to Virginia.
Almost constantly she talked of Orianna,
and on learning that she was Marian’s sister,
her delight was unbounded. When intelligence
was received that she had been placed
at school in Philadelphia, Capt. Wilder,
yielding to Ella’s importunities, consented
to send her there also. Ella had not taken
into consideration how greatly changed her
Indian friend must necessarily be, and when,
on reaching Philadelphia, a beautiful young
lady entered the room, neatly and fashionably
attired, she could scarcely believe that
it was her companion of the forest.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Orianna’s request they became roommates,
and it was difficult to tell which was
more child-like, the tall maiden of twenty-one,
or the curly-haired girl of nine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Five years seems a long, long time, but to
Orianna it soon glided away, and then she
left school, a much better scholar than now
is often graduated at our most fashionable
seminaries. During her stay in Philadelphia,
she had become greatly attached to the city,
and Robert, whose wealth would admit of
his living where he pleased, purchased a
handsome dwelling, fitting it up according
to his own taste, which was rather luxurious.</p>

<p class='c007'>Six years from the night of Marian’s bridal,
there was another wedding at the house
of Mr. Gorton, and Orianna, now a beautiful
woman of twenty-six, was the bride. George
and Marian both were present, together with
a lisping Charlie, and a dark-eyed baby
“Orianna,” who made most wondrous efforts
to grasp the long diamond earrings which
hung from its auntie’s ears, for, Indian-like,
Orianna’s passion for jewellery was strong and
well developed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Narretta, too, was there, but the
lovely young creature whose head so fondly
lay upon her lap, asking her blessing,
was unseen, for Narretta was now
stone blind. Already in her superstitious
imagination warnings had
come from the spirit world, bidding her prepare
to meet Owanno. Gladly would Orianna
have taken her to her Philadelphia
home, but she answered, “No, I will die and
be buried in the woods;” and the first letter
which went from Mrs. Gorton to her daughter
told that Narretta was at rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the first anniversary of Orianna’s wedding
day, Robert, still madly in love with
his handsome wife, wished to give her a
pleasant surprise. Accordingly, besides the
numerous other costly presents which he
brought her, he presented her with a large
square box, saying that its contents were for
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Opening it, Orianna saw disclosed to view
the old Indian dress whose loss she
years before had wept. Bright as the sunlight
of her happy home were the tears
which glittered in her large black eyes, as,
glancing at the rich heavy silk which now
composed her dress, she said, “Oh, Bob, how
could you?” and Bob answered, “How
could I what?”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
